# vom-scripts

### Misc. scripts I've written over the years.

* oui.pl
    MAC (OUI) registration lookup (Company name).

* wepscii.pl
    Convert ascii->hex, hex->ascii for WEP keys.

* revwalk.pl
    Walk a CIDR (IPv4) and lookup PTRs.

* neighbor-list.pl
    ARP/ND with gravy.  Print out all neighbors, MAC vendor, RDNS, etc.  (Linux)
